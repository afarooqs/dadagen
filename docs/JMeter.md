### JMeter Data Provider

Dadagen has been embeded into a Simple JMeter Plugin that allows you to generate random data for your test threads.

You can download the JMeter Plugin Jar from bintray - [JMeter Plugin 0.2.9](https://bintray.com/artifact/download/inosion/maven/org/inosion/dadagen/dadagen-jmeter/0.2.9/dadagen-jmeter-plugin-0.2.9.jar)
You will need to put it into you JMETER_HOME/lib/ext

You will then have a new Config Element called "Dadagen Random Data Generator"

Hopefully the configuration is very self explanatory.

And here is a sample of the resulting "variables"

Enjoy!!
